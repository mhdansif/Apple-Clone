                    ◊ Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) is a 0% APR payment option that is only
                    available if you select it at checkout in the U.S. for eligible products purchased
                    at Apple Store locations, apple.com (Opens in a new window), the Apple Store app,
                    or by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE, and is subject to credit approval and credit limit.
                    See support.apple.com/102730 (Opens in a new window) for more information about
                    eligible products. Existing customers: See your Customer Agreement for your
                    variable APR. As of July 1, 2025, the variable APR on new Apple Card accounts
                    ranges from 18.24% to 28.49%. You must elect to use ACMI at checkout. If you buy
                    an ACMI-eligible product with a one-time payment on Apple Card at checkout, that
                    purchase is subject to your Apple Card’s variable APR, not the ACMI 0% APR. Taxes
                    and shipping on items purchased using ACMI are subject to your Apple Card’s
                    variable APR, not the ACMI 0% APR. In order to buy an iPhone with ACMI, you must
                    select one of the following carriers: AT&T, Boost Mobile, T-Mobile, or Verizon. An
                    iPhone purchased with ACMI is always unlocked, so you can switch carriers at any
                    time, subject to your carrier’s terms. ACMI is not available for purchases made
                    online at the following special stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating
                    corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses;
                    Government and Veterans and Military Purchase Programs; or on refurbished devices.
                    The last month’s payment for each product will be the product’s purchase price,
                    less all other payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI is subject to change
                    at any time for any reason, including but not limited to installment term lengths
                    and eligible products. See the Apple Card Customer Agreement (Opens in a new window)
                    for more information about ACMI.
